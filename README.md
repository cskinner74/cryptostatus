REQUIRES PYTHON3

### Files
* cryptostatus.py - Command line tool to view data about different cryptocurrencies, current prices, hi/low trends, etc.
* notify.py - designed to be a background script, command line arguments allow user to set high and low price thresholds, and the script will alert the user if the price crosses a threshold with a popup notification. (Only works in \*Nix systems right now).
